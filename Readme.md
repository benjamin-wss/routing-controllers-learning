### Node.js >=16.10

Corepack is included by default with all Node.js installs, but is currently opt-in. To enable it, run the following command:

```
corepack enable
```

### Node.js <16.10

Corepack isn't included with Node.js in versions before the 16.10; to address that, run:

```
npm i -g corepack
```
